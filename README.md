# Machine-learning-game

A program created for my A level computer science which teaches children how to draw hand draw digits. The game is a platform game in which the player has to revive ghosts by correctly drawing digit above the ghosts head. A convolutional neural network model predicts the drawn digit and if the output matches the ghosts number the ghost is revived. The model was created using Tensorflow, Keras and numpy.The game was created using pygame. 

Due to the a level year being shorted by COVID the comments are unfinished and suggest small improvements to the code.
